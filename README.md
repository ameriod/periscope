Periscope
=========

Simple library that injects the [Telescope's](https://github.com/mattprecious/telescope) TelescopeLayout into the
root of any Activity. This is done so that there can be one set of views for every build type.

Usage
-----
For usage see the [Telescope](https://github.com/mattprecious/telescope) and the included sample project.

Permissions
-----------

Just like Telescope the `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` Pre-KitKat is required to take screen shots and the `VIBRATE`
permission is required to enable the vibration.

Configuration
-------------

See [Telescope](https://github.com/mattprecious/telescope/README.MD#Configuration) and use the included builder.
